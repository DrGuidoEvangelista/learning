# Important R packages : 
# one package to load them all is pacman : package manager
# I can use pacman to install new packages which I can see on the right in RStudio
# To load new packages all I have to do is this 
#but first we have to install pacman
install.packages('pacman')
library(pacman)
#then we add more packages that we need
pacman::p_load (pacman,dplyr,GGally, ggplot2,ggthemes, ggvis, httr, lubridate, plotly, rmarkdown, shiny, stringr, tidyr)

#On RStudio we can see all the packages, installed and not, on the lower right side

#to unload some packages there is an easy function
p_unload(httr, dplyr)

#or to unload all of them
p_unload(all)
